The AmphiBac database relies on open-access tools (R, GitHub, and vsearch) to provide access to and useage of the database. While open-source software is the bee's knees, there can often time be a learning curve as to how to use these tools (we've all been there). As such, we have provided step-by-step tools to guide you through the use of the R-package with as much explanation as we can provide.

<ol>
<li>From raw reads to database ready analysis (for beginners of high-throughput sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA gene data) </i>
<li>Importing your data into R from common bioinformatics pacakges (e.g. QIIME2, mothur, etc)</i>
<li>Comparing your sequences to the AmphiBac Database</i>
<li>Calculate the percentage of inhibitory/enhancing/noninhibitory taxa </i>
<li>Create a ASV/OTU table of inhibitory taxa</i>
<li>Antifungal richness calculations</i>
<li>Implement filtering to subset database based on metadata (e.g. country, frog species)</i>
<li>Pull the latest AmphiBac database (one is provided on CRAN, but we do update it inbetween CRAN releases...we're good like that)</i>
